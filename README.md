# SVG Logo Generator

## Description

The SVG Logo Generator is a command-line application designed for freelance web developers who wish to quickly generate simple logos for their projects without the need for a graphic designer. This tool allows users to create custom logos with up to three characters, a choice of shape (circle, triangle, or square), and customizable colors for both text and shape.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system

### Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine, then do an npm install to install the the necessary dependencies

## Usage
Navigate to the root directory of the project:
cd path/to/logo-generator

Run the application:
node index.js
Follow the prompts in the command line to select your logo's text, text color, shape, and shape color.
